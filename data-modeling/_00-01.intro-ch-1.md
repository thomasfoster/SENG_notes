### Introduction

This book will help me become a **master at creating data models** - diagrammitic and textual expressions of the kinds of data that an organization, a business, or a culture consideres worth remembering.

A software system should help people do work, Work with data. ex:

- Remembering things
- Calculating things
- Displaying things

We're focusing on how sofware can improve the **storage**, **manipulation**, and **display** of **data**.

Questions remain.

**Who gets helped?**  
Does the system help everyone equally or do some workloads increrease while others decrease?

**When do people get helped?**  
Does the system pay dividends immediately or does it take time to pay off? Ex: years of data entry to be usable.

Not referring to the learning curve

**What constitutes help?**
